# Barriers to data sharing in music psychology

This repository contains the survey data concerning barriers to data sharing in music psychology. The survey replicates the work by Houtkoop, Chambers, Macleod, Bishop, Nichols, and Wagenmaker ([2018](https://doi.org/10.1177/2515245917751886)), who surveyed why scholars (psychologists) may not want to share the data.

**The survey is ongoing. This was launched in September 2025 and it will close at the end of year 2025.**

Interim results can be found at [https://tuomaseerola.github.io/barriers2datasharing](https://tuomaseerola.github.io/barriers2datasharing).
