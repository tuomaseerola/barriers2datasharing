# Barriers to datasharing in music psychology

This repository contains the survey data concerning barriers to data sharing in music psychology. The survey replicates the work by Houtkoop, Chambers, Macleod, Bishop, Nichols, and Wagenmaker ([2018](https://doi.org/10.1177/2515245917751886)), who surveyed why scholars (psychologists) may not want to share the data.
