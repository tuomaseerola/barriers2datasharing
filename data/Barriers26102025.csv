For example, at my institution, there are online resources, guidance and policies in place around data sharing, but these are somewhat vague and I have found myself needing to use my own initiative to figure how, when, and where to share my data (i.e., you only come across basic information if you actively look for it).

Sharing data was never something that my institution or supervisors actively advised or prompted me to engage with during my doctoral research, and there were no expectations or requirements for me to share my data in any form at the end of my PhD. I personally found this to be counter-productive and at odds with the idea of doing research that is ""for the public good"" and sharing knowledge, idealistic though that maybe sounds.

I therefore think that universities, in particular, but also departments and research groups need to actively engage in best training around data sharing, so that people understand how and why it should be done. This could/should perhaps be crystallised through ethics training, for instance, so that it becomes as natural and instinctive a part of the research lifecycle as obtaining ethical approval for our research (i.e., the default should be for us to have an instinct to share anonymised data)."

In addition, data sharing should be the default, and if it is NOT shared, there needs to be a statement explaining why not, to be reviewed and assessed by journal and reviewers. For publicly funded project, data availability/sharing (at least anonymised) should be a strict requirement to be enforced by the funding body and institutions with immediate consequences if violated. I don't think we need financial rewards for data sharing, this should really be the default and an expectation towards scientists, unless convincingly demonstrated that in a particular case it is not viable. I also strongly believe that 'upon request' is a big issue in our field, I have had exclusively bad experiences with this. Either because researcher never responded, or because they tried to strong arm themselves into IP or co-author position, whereas in my mind, after published, (most) data belongs to the public, rather than being gate-kept by individuals. That's a key difference between public and private sector research that I think we should enforce as a community."
